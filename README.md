System Design
Data layer: Room Entities (Subject, ClassSchedule, AttendanceRecord) with DAOs for Subjects, Schedules, and Records.

Domain logic: Attendance math (present/total) and percentage computations exposed via ViewModel methods.

Schedules: Day-of-week + start/end time; ‚Äúcurrent‚Äù and ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù state derived using LocalTime.

Reminders: Weekly exact alarms at class end-time per schedule; rescheduled weekly and after boot.

Foreground notifications: Full-screen-capable high-priority channel with Present/Absent action buttons.

Holiday logic: A single HOLIDAY record per date; day tap requests confirmation to convert and remove other records.

Calendar: Horizontal calendar showing present/absent/mixed/holiday day coloring with today‚Äôs highlight and holiday toggle.

Stats: Donut chart, total/present/absent counts, and per-subject breakdown with color and target comparison.

Subject detail: Per-subject donut, target, and calendar for date-specific mark/clear (+ manual add and edit/delete subject).

Permissions Used
POST_NOTIFICATIONS for Android 13+ reminders.

RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED to reschedule alarms on device restart.

SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM for precise class reminders.

VIBRATE for subtle haptic feedback.

Action receivers save attendance, update stats notification, and warn if below target.

Boot receiver enumerates subjects/schedules to reschedule all alarms after restart.

Data Model
Subject: id, name, color, targetAttendance.

ClassSchedule: id, subjectId, dayOfWeek, startHour:Minute, endHour:Minute.

AttendanceRecord: id, subjectId?, scheduleId?, date (epochDay), isPresent, note, type {CLASS, HOLIDAY, MANUAL}.

Open in Android Studio (latest) and let Gradle sync automatically.

Build and run on a device/emulator with API 26+.

On first launch, accept notifications and allow ‚Äúignore battery optimizations‚Äù for reliable reminders.

Add a subject, configure weekly schedules, set a target, and start marking attendance.

Developer Notes
Room db: AppDatabase v2 with fallbackToDestructiveMigration for development convenience.

ViewModel: Single source for flows: subjects, attendance records, subjectsWithAttendance, and today‚Äôs schedule with holiday awareness.

Exact alarms: Conditionally scheduled if allowed on Android 12+; legacy path for older devices.
